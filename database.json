      "description": "Leviathan Wakes is set in a future in which humanity has colonized much of the Solar System. Earth, governed by the United Nations, and the Martian Congressional Republic act as competing superpowers, maintaining an uneasy military alliance in order to exert dual hegemony over the peoples of the Asteroid belt, known as 'Belters'. Belters, whose bodies tend to be thin and elongated owing to their low-gravity environments, carry out the gritty, blue-collar work that provides the system with essential natural resources, but are largely marginalized by the rest of the Solar System polity. This class conflict particularly manifests itself in The Outer Planets Alliance (OPA), a network of loosely-aligned militant groups, which seeks to combat the Belt's exploitation at the hands of the 'Inners', who, in turn, have collectively branded the OPA a terrorist organization.",
